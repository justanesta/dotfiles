# Notes on classic confinement (snap):
# - classic: true = Less sandboxing, more system access (needed for some apps)
# - classic: false or omitted = Strict confinement, more sandboxed and secure
# - Classic confinement is required for apps that need full filesystem access or system integration
# - Examples: IDEs (need file access), browsers (need various system integrations)
